Posts"},"https://esoterra.dev/blog/a-more-perfect-derive/":{"body":"§What is Derive?\nIn some languages, users need to write (or use tools to generate) boilerplate implementations for common functionality (like debug printing, comparison, hashing) over and over again  on each type they define.\n\nRust has an awesome feature called \"derive\" and using it we can write #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)] and the implementations will be generated at compile time. This improves productivity and removes an easy place for little mistakes to be made.\n\n§How Should Derive Handle Generics?\nWhen we derive a trait for a type that has generic parameters, it may not be possible to generate an implementation without putting bounds on those parameters.\nFor example, in the following Pair type, it is only possible to Debug print Pair&lt;X&gt; if X can be Debug printed.\n\nThis can be expressed by the following impl bound.\n\n§What About More Complex Generics?\nSome types use a generic type parameter without actually structurally including a value of that type directly. For example, the following type List&lt;T&gt; doesn't include a a T directly.\n\nFor some traits like Debug, a wrapper like Rc around a T will only implement a trait if T does. For other traits like Clone, this isn't necessarily true because an Rc&lt;T&gt; is Clone even if T isn't.\nThat means that we don't actually need to bound our Clone implementation for List&lt;T&gt; with T: Clone. It could look like the following:\n\nHowever, with the current derive implementation it still actually has a bound like in the Pair-Debug example and looks like the following.\n\nThat's because the Rust derive mechanism makes a conservative assumption: we shouldn't leak information about the fields of a type into the bounds of the derived implementation. If the internals of List&lt;T&gt; change, it may not be possible to derive Clone without bounds in the future and that could accidentally introduce a breaking change.\n§What is Perfect Derive?\nThe name \"Perfect Derive\" refers to a derive algorithm which generates implementations without any unnecessary bounds. It has been discussed by the Rust lang team (GitHub issue, Notes) and by the blog smallcultfollowing.com. The examples in the previous section are just a reiteration of what's covered by these sources.\n§Why not just turn on Perfect Derive?\nIf in future editions of Rust the derive macro becomes \"perfect\", then users switching to the new edition may have the bounds on their derived trait implementations change in subtle ways which cause breakages.\nSome of these users won't even be aware of these subtleties or the change and will likely be very confused. Others may be aware of the update, but not want to change the behavior of their crate or use the new perfect derive anyway because it makes it easier to cause breaking changes.\nIf you want to learn more about the challenges to \"just doing it\", I highly recommend the smallcultfollowing.com post.\n§Design Solutions\nI think perfect derive should be opt-in in a clear way, so that we don't confuse users and they make an intentional choice between leaking implementation details in their API for more precise bounds or using the more conservative current approach.\n§Separate Macro\nOne option is for users to choose between two attribute macros: one that performs perfect derive and one that performs classic derive. This is already possible today using the perfect-derive crate.\n\nHowever, I don't think it's obvious to users what a name like this means, when they should use it, and why derive doesn't always work this way. So I'm not sure if this is the right option.\n§Type Attributes\nAnother approach would be to let the user indicate when defining a type what types they want their derived implementations to be bound on. If this attribute is not provided, the generic parameters would be used, which is the same as the current behavior.\n\nBy adding this attribute, users can get whatever bounds they want including what perfect derive would have chosen.\n\nThis is very explicit and encourages users to think explicitly about what bounds they want on their trait implementations.\n§Field Attributes\nAnother idea I had is to put an attribute on the fields of the type which indicates that the bounds may be narrowed using information about that field's type.\n\nIn this model, both adding and removing the bound_derive attribute and changing the type of a field labeled bound_derive are potentially breaking changes, but changing the type of any other field is not. This seems like a reasonable behavior and parallels the semantics of pub.\nIf multiple fields use the same type parameter T but only some are marked bound_derive, then either pessimistic bounds need to be emitted which still bound on T or it should be rejected as ambiguous.\n\n§Wrap Up\nOut of these options, I think field attributes are probably the most elegant. Giving users the tools to communicate when they want a field's type to become a public part of the API of their derived type by explicitly saying \"hey you can use this\" and in a way that mirrors pub feels like a great solution.\nI don't currently have the time to implement this proposal or write an RFC, but hopefully this will bring some attention to perfect derive and ways to solve it.\nCheers,\n-Robin\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/blog/a-more-perfect-derive/","title":"A More Perfect Derive"},"https://esoterra.dev/blog/confidential-consensus/":{"body":"Currently, the Confidential Computing community is focused on use cases with very high security requirements,\nlike the government and military, where applications must be protected from the Cloud Service Provider or the host machine in general.\nThese scenarios involve a traditional client/server environment where the server just needs to be a bit more secure.\n\n    \n\nConfidential Computing can be used for much more than that though.\nAs currently envisioned, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)\nprovided by Confidential Computing systems offer an exciting trade off built on specialized hardware encryption features.\nIf you trust the hardware provider, you can run code on data that even the host cannot see or interfere with.\n\n    \n    If you trust the TEE features, you don't have to trust the host\n\nThis has the potential to enable a new class of federated systems where\nthe host of a given instance has well-defined limits to the data they can view and the actions they can perform.\nIf the clients can verify that the instance is running in a TEE and is running open source code they have audited,\nthey can know what the host can and can't do with their data.\nThis could be especially valuable in social media &amp; messaging applications where users want to know that their privacy is being protected.\n\n    \n    Users can interact through a federated instance without trusting the operator\n\nIn a fully distributed system, we can achieve Confidential Consensus\nwhere each node runs in a TEE and acts as a replicated state machine processing encrypted events so that some of the system's state remains private.\nSuch systems will need a way to securely bootstrap so that the initial node(s) are known to be in TEEs\nand a way to ensure that any new nodes added to the system are also TEEs.\nThis approach could offer a more dynamic and redundant version of a federated system where groups of users form networks\nrepresenting a given instance or the ability to create a more globally distributed system.\n\n    \n\nTo pull this off, Confidential Computing systems will need to be flexible enough that they can run on diverse hardware.\nTo this end frameworks like Enarx that abstract individual hardware security features\nand enable cross-platform usage will be crucial.\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/blog/confidential-consensus/","title":"Confidential Consensus"},"https://esoterra.dev/blog/embeddable-webassembly-parsers/":{"body":"Developer tooling has grown by leaps and bounds.\nPopular languages have strong support in multiple editors, linters, formatters, code review tools, and more.\nEven so, tools that support a wide variety of programming languages are hard to write and maintain.\nWebAssembly (Wasm) as a compact, portable, and secure format for programs presents a new option for building polyglot tools:\nparsers written in Wasm-supporting languages that can be leveraged by various tools.\nThese could be generated by parser generators or written by hand,\nenable support for every class of language grammar,\nand can be consumed in any environment where Wasm can be run.\nSo any browser and anywhere wasmtime can be run\n(hint: that’s almost everywhere) would be able to use them.\n§Components and Interfaces\nWebAssembly has an evolving component model\nthat makes it easier for WASM modules to talk to other modules through high-level interfaces.\nThis allows us to create an interface definition .wit\nfile that specifies what it means to be a parser.\nThe simplest version of this might take in a string, and output a JSON representation of the parse tree.\n\nOnce we define the output format, even this very simple interface is enough to get us started\nand enables us to write parsers in Wasm languages that work on any platform.\nThis is still pretty low level though and doesn't offer very much structure (and potentially performance).\nIt's also a bit silly that you have to then parse your parser output as JSON. We can do better.\n§A Higher Level Interface\nLet's make an interface that is higher level and actually encodes the structure of a parse tree\n§Tokens\nWe'll start by defining a record type to represent tokens.\n\nEach token gets a string label that identifies what kind of token it is (e.g. identifier, keyword)\nand a span that identifies what part of the input it represents.\nSpan info is crucial to the functioning of formatters, linters, and many other tools.\n§Parse Tree\nNow that we can represent tokens, we need to represent the parse tree itself.\nCurrently, the WIT format does not support recursive type definitions which are the typical way of doing this.\nInstead, we'll use indexes to provide a little indirection.\n\n§The Parser\nNow we have all the tools we need to describe the parser interface.\nA parser simply transforms a string into parser output.\n\nKeen readers might notice that there is no explicit mention of error handling so far.\nIn this simplified example, errors will simply be encoded as tokens and branches with a special label.\nFuture expansions to EWPs could add more explicit error handling.\n§Implementing the Interface\nThe interface we just wrote isn't hypothetical, we can implement it right now!\nUsing Rust and the wit-bindgen project\nwe can create some scaffolding that looks like this.\nThe wit_bindgen_rust export line tells bindgen that we want to export the interface we defined,\nwhich just means that we will provide an implementation for other components to use.\n\nFrom there we just need to implement the tokenizing and parsing logic for our language of choice.\nI chose to use JSON since it is simple and practical.\nThe source code for this is available on GitHub\nbut is too long to cover in this article.\n§Consuming the Interface\nNow that we have defined a simple Embeddable WASM Parser interface and implemented it for a language,\nit's time to use that implementation to do something useful.\n§EWP Tool Example\nThere are a wide variety of things you could do with the ability to parse arbitrary languages,\nbut in the spirit of keeping things simple our example is just going to print the parse tree in a nice format.\nThe tool will take in the path to a parser's WASM file and the file to parse and print out\nthe parse tree as an S-expression like so.\n\n§Using a Runtime\nThe tool is going to need to execute Embeddable WASM Parsers, which means it needs a runtime.\nWe'll use wasmtime which is an official project of the Bytecode Alliance,\na non-profit foundation building Open Source implementations of the standard.\nWe'll create a new crate called tree-ewp with dependencies for running and talking to our WASM runtime.\n\nIn our code, we just instantiate the runtime, load and initialize our WASM file, execute the parse function, and then print the output.\n\nPrinting S-expressions is done with a few recursive functions that keep track of the indentation.\nYou can see how that's done and the rest of the tree-ewp tool in the GitHub repo.\n§Wrap Up\nWebAssembly is an incredibly promising technology enabling new levels of security and portability for code.\nIts modularity allows us to share code conforming to specified interfaces as a way to solve specific problems,\nand it can be used to create portable parsers that we can run anywhere.\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/blog/embeddable-webassembly-parsers/","title":"Embeddable WebAssembly Parsers"},"https://esoterra.dev/blog/fixing-12-hour-time/":{"body":"§12-Hour Time is Confusing\nWhen we teach children to read clocks and tell time, they're often confused by the strange combination of rules we follow.\nEven some adults mix up whether midnight is in the a.m. or p.m. and how many hours are between two times that span noon.\nThis confusing complexity isn't intrinsic! It can be removed!\n§12-Hour Time is Discontinuous\nA sensible 12-hour time system would be continuous and linear within its 12-hour segments. Any times (N):mm a.m. and (N+1):mm a.m. should be 1 hour apart and any (N):mm p.m. and (N+1):mm p.m. should be too.\nSadly, 12:30 p.m. is actually 11 hours before 11:30 p.m..\nIn my opinion, this is where a lot of the confusion about hours of the day and distances in time comes from.\n§Implied 24-Hour Value\nOne simple way to demonstrate how 12-hour time deviates from intuition is to imagine a simple hypothetical rule: the 24-hour time for a 12-hour time is equal to its 12-hour time if it is a.m. and equal to 12 hours later if it is p.m.. This rule isn't how 12-hour time works, but plotting the values it gives us makes 12-hour time's major issue obvious.\n\n242322212019181716151413121110987654321012123456789101112123456789101112a.m.p.m.a.m.\nA plot of how current \"discontinuous\" 12-hour time maps to implied time.\n\nThis also presents an obvious way to create intra-segment intra-day continuity.

(even if we shouldn't)\n§Segment-Amplitude\nThe approach for inter-segment inter-day continuity will look a little different and we'll start by using a different visualization.\nInstead of focusing on the \"implied 24-hour value\" we're going to focus on the amplitude of each time ignoring whether they are a.m. or p.m..\n\n121110987654321012123456789101112123456789101112\nPlotting time values ignoring a.m./p.m. in order\n\nFor the next step we're going to take a hint from what \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" actually stand for:\n\nante meridiem which translates to \"before midday\"\npost meridiem which translates to \"after midday\"\n\nWhat's strange about this is that \"11 a.m.\" isn't really \"11 hours before midday\" though \"11 p.m.\" does mean \"11 hours after midday, but what if they did match?\nWhat if HH:mm a.m. meant HH hours and mm minutes before noon instead?\nInstead of hours increasing up till 12 and then resetting to 1, they would go up to 12 and down to zero and then back up and then back down.\nIntuitively this would mean that 12 hours after midday is equal to 12 hours before midday of the next!\n\n1211109876543210121211109876543210123456789101112\nContinuous 12-hour time\n\nBy reversing the order of time in the a.m., we've finally reached a truly inter-segment inter-day continuous 12-hour time, which I propose we call Continuous 12-Hour Time a.k.a.

12-hour time across 2 days\n\nIn addition to continuity, it's also much easier to tell how long durations of time ranges that cross noon, which are very common, are: you can simply add the a.m. start time to the p.m. end time!\nNotably, this innovation can't be applied to 24-hour time demonstrating why 24-hour time shouldn't be taken seriously.\n§Clocks\nThis will obviously have both foreseeable and unforeseeable consequences and implications for clocks and the keeping of time.\nAs we begin to implement it, I'm sure we'll figure out the details.\nAt some point I hope to build a physical

portable, and secure unit of code.\nThey're a compile target with a binary format, not a source code language.\nSo you won't write them by hand, you'll have tools to generate them for you.\n\nIn addition to languages like Rust, C++, JavaScript, and Python that are \"General Purpose\",\ncertain Domain-Specific languages may be good candidates for \"componentizing\".\n\nFor example,\n\n    \n        parser/grammar languages (e.g. lex, yacc)\n        can be compiled to components with a single parse function that\n        takes in text and returns an AST and\n    \n    \n        templating languages (e.g. handlebars, pug)\n        can be compiled into components with a single function that\n        takes in parameters and returns the filled in template.\n    \n\n§Template-to-Component Compiler\nLet's focus on the second example and make a compiler that converts templates into components!\nA Wasm component has a type that's defined by a \"world\" in the\nWIT interface-definition language\nwhich identifies all the things the component imports and exports.\nFor simple templates, we don't need any imports and we have exactly one export which is our templating function.\n\nThe exact fields and types that the parameters record has will depend on what our template\nuses and we can infer that directly from the template file.\n§Canonical ABI\nTo implement this high-level interface, we need to use the canonical ABI\nwhich defines the way that high-level component types can be\npassed into and returned from components using integer values\nand the Wasm linear memory.\n\n    \n\n\n§Lifting and Lowering\nIn the Canonical ABI, the Component Model is higher (as in higher-level)\nthan Core Wasm and Modules.\nSo, when things need to be converted upwards from Core Wasm to the Component Model, it's called lifting.\nConversely, when things need to be converted downards from the Component Model to Core Wasm, it's called lowering.\n\n    \n\n\n§Imported and Exported Functions\nWhen talking about functions, the direction of lifting and lowering corresponds\nto whether the function is an export or import.\nExported functions are defined in the inner module and lifted to the component which re-exports it.\nImported functions are defined by a component import and lowered to the module import.\n\n    \n\nFor exports and imports, the arguments go in the direction from caller to callee\nand the returns go from callee to caller.\n\n    \n\n§Values\nValues in the canonical ABI are either passed directly in arguments/returns\nas a sequence of core Wasm values (e.g. i32, f32) or indirectly using memory.\nThe default is for values to be passed directly and memory indirection is used\nwhen the value is too large to be passed directly or the value is part of a list.\n\n    Note: you can find more information in the \n    \n        canonical-abi/definitions.py\n    \n\nThe canonical ABI allows components to select which string encoding to lift/lower strings from/into\nand we will be choosing UTF-8 (the other options are UTF-16 and Latin 1 + UTF-16).\nStrings in the canonical ABI are represented as an offset and length which has the direct\nrepresentation (i32, i32) and a memory representation of two 4-byte little endian integers.\n\n    \n\nRecords are represented directly by concatenating the direct representation of all their fields in order\nand are represented in memory by aligning and concatenating the memory representation of each field in order.\n§Template ABI\nThe generated template function is exported, which means it will be defined in the module\nthen lifted and rexported in the outer component.\nIt has a single record argument, which is lowered into the template,\nand it has a single string result, which is lifted back up to the caller.\nDepending on the number of string parameters the parameter record will either\nbe passed directly or in memory.\n§Allocators\nIn order to use the canonical ABI with arguments spilled to memory\n(which can happen depending on the number of parameters),\nwe have to provide an allocator for the host to use for allocating\nthe spilled args.\nThere are many kinds of allocators but because we're only ever using\nit to allocate arguments which are then all freed together we can\nuse one of the simplest allocators called a bump allocator.\n§Generating the Module\nTo return a string, we just need to return the integer index in memory of the (index, length) pair.\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/blog/template-compiler/","title":"Template Compiler

This is really silly though, because the runtime has counters for all of them anyway, the refcount. Our state of the art counting sort implementation uses those counters instead of its own for... performance?\n\n§Counting values\nThe same mechanism that lets us perform counting sort, taking refcounts before and after deleting things, allows us to count arbitrary lists contents as well.\n\n§Comparing and Sorting by refcount\nThe library also provides utilities for comparing the refcounts of two values and sorting sequences of values by refcount.\n\nSee the Integers section to find out why these are subtly non-trivial.\n§Considerations, Caveats, and Curiosities\nMost of the characteristics of sys.getrefcount are intuitive and you might guess, but others you may not.\n§str Interning\nStrings in Python sometimes act as separate objects that don't is compare true and don't have the same refcount, but some are the same and do. The latter case is due to interning, where Python stores one str object for multiple (potentially independent) instances of the same string value.\nInterning sometimes happens automatically, like in all string literals, and can also be done manual, using sys.intern. Be aware of when interning is/isn't happening and how that may affect the behavior of refcounting.\n§int and bool Interning\nSimilarly to strings, integers and boolean values are also interned but following different rules. Any time an integer (within some size limit) is returned by an arithmetic operation, Python pulls the correct integer object from a table instead of creating a new one incrementing the count for that integer. Booleans work much the same way but are always interned because there are only two possible values.\nOne fun quirk of this is that the integers returned by sys.getrefcount can be interned and increment the refcount for that integer. Under very specific circumstances this can change the outcome of a comparison.\n\nThis may sound very precise and very unlikely, but it really isn't.\nIt can easily occur whenever sorting or comparing small integer values by refcount.\nFor robustness, all comparisons in the refcursed library either use float(sys.getrefcount(...)) to store refcounts without modifying others or compensate for the case above.\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/projects/refcursed/","title":"Refcursed"},"https://esoterra.dev/projects/template-compiler/":{"body":"This project compiles template files based on Nunjucks to WebAssembly (Wasm) Components.\nThe template does not have to be valid HTML. It can be any text you want.\nThe components the compiler generates export a single function that takes in parameters and returns the template output string.\nIt currently supports parameter interpolation (via {{ param }} syntax) and conditional rendering (via {% if param %}...{% endif %} syntax).\nI don't currently have time to dedicate to the project, but I would like to add more features eventually like loops/repeated rendering, dotted/nested parameter names, filters, and async streams.\n§Basic Example\n\nWrite a template in the nunjucks-like style template-compiler supports like so.\n\n\n\nThe compiler will generate a Wasm Component with an inferred component type like the following.\n\n\n\nThe component can now be provided to a Wasm Component runtime (like Wasmtime) and its exported apply function called.\n\nThe full code required to invoke the compiler and run the component in this example is available in the \"website_cond\" test.\n§Compiler CLI\nThe CLI is extremely simple and has no subcommands. There are named parameters for input path and output path. The --help flag is available.\n\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/projects/template-compiler/","title":"Template Compiler"},"https://esoterra.dev/projects/wow/":{"body":"§Installing wow\n\n§Initialized a workspace\nRunning wow init will set up the current workspace.\nThe current directory must contain a wow.kdl file.\n\nIn this scenario initializing\n\nDetects the wow.kdl config file\nPulls ba:wasm-tools@1.2\nCreates ~/.wow/shims/wasm-tools shim\n\n§Using commands\nOnce you've installed wow and initialized your workspace, you can call the defined tools using the names you specified in your wow.kdl file.\n\n§WIP tools\nWe're going to work on getting the following tools compiled to components, available in registries, and usable in wow as soon as we can.\n\n\nwasm-tools\n\nwac\n\nclaw-cli\n\n","id":"https://esoterra.dev/projects/wow/","title":"Workspaces on Wasm!

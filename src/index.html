<h1>Kyle Brown</h1>

<p>
    I'm Kyle Brown.
    I am an optimistic and often idealistic Software Engineer.
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful about the potential of technologies like <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
    I think we can use them to build a solid foundation for the future of Software Engineering
    and I'm proud to work on and with them.
</p>

<p>
    I think compilers are our friends, constraints are guarantees,
    and the fundamental problem of Software Engineering is balancing investing in the future and solving current problems.
</p>

<p>
    I am also a human being (shocking but it's true) and I have a wide variety of other interests and hobbies that I have not yet but may eventually write about here too.

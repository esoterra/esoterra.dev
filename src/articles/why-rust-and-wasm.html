<p>
    I talk a lot about Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm).
    Maybe these sound a lot like <em>shiny new things</em>,
    and they are but that&apos;s only one piece of the story.
    What else do they have in common?
</p>

<h2>Core promises</h2>
<p>
    Rust and Wasm share a lot of the same core promises, ones they deliver on.
</p>
<p>
    They are both <q><strong>Secure</strong></q>.
    Rust&apos;s memory model addresses a large class of common vulnerabilities
    and Wasm&apos;s capability-orientation and strong validation/isolation
    offer new opportunities for security.
</p>

<p>
    They are both <q><strong>Performant</strong></q>.
    Rust&apos;s systems-level design and strictness
    allow advanced user and compiler optimizations.
    Wasm&apos;s low-level stack machine instruction set
    and strong typing let it compile to efficient machine code on virtually all machines.
</p>
<p>
    They are both <q><strong>Portable</strong></q>.
    Rust compiles well to commonly supported platforms and its standard library
    does a good job of abstracting platform specifics where possible.
    Wasm is king of platform independence, its semantics are well-defined
    and any compliant embedding will behave the same;
    under some constraints even deterministically!
</p>
<p>
    Those are some cool features! I like them and I think
    they&apos;re well suited to the requirements of many of today&apos;s application&apos;s requirements. But what if I
    told you that they&apos;re not the <em>real</em> reason I love these technologies?
</p>

<h2>The <q>Real</q> Reason</h2>

<p>
    More fundamentally than security, performance, and portability,
    these technologies <strong>make sense</strong> and <strong>free us from many legacies</strong>.
    They offer us a future where we have the tools to better manage the complexity of our field.
</p>
<p>
    They are new and some people might say they&apos;ve been taking forever to get off the ground,
    but that&apos;s because they&apos;ve learned a ton from what came before,
    and spent their time making the best decisions they could.
    They stand on the shoulder&apos;s of giants and decades of experience,
    and they made the most of that.
</p>
<p>
    I&apos;m not trying to insult any predecessors and I don&apos;t want to imply that newer = better;
    there are plenty of counter-examples.
    Not every new technology will be shinier and/or better than the last,
    but sometimes things that come along that are unique opportunities
    and if we can protect them they can become something incredible.
</p>
<p>
    Enough waxing poetic,
    let&apos;s talk about the <q>sensible</q> future
    these technologies enable and why it&apos;s so worth pursuing.
</p>

<h2>A Bright Future</h2>

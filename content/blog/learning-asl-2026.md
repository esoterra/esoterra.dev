In NC, it seems that the Triad area (Greensboro, Winston-Salem, High Point) has the highest concentration of ASL use (source: [CSDHH map](https://www.csdhh.org/where-we-work)). In-person classes and events tend to be offered in those areas more than other areas like the Triangle although there is still activity here.

## North Carolina Organizations
